# Goal

This is a place for me to _learn_ Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Priorities

### High
1. Correct — Everything should be highly tested.
1. Readable — We should be able to understand the logic even if years pass since we read it.
1. Repeatable — We should be able to read the code once and then re-implement from scratch.

### Medium
A fast implementation is more important than a lean one.

1. Generic — If X can use _generics_ do so.
1. Optimal in time
1. Optimal in memory

### Low priority
1. Complete — If variants are interesting enough, we should add them.
1. Dog-food — If we have a version we should use it.
